# computational-thread-art

This project contains code that renders an image as a series of lines connecting pins around a circular frame. For more detail in the physical implementation of these pieces, see my Medium page. This repository contains 2 Python scripts:

* **alg_bare** only contains the bare essentials to run the algorithm and generate your own computational pieces. For instructions on exactly how to run the algorithm, see below.
* **alg_full** contains all the same elements as alg_bare, but includes a detailed description of how each part works (so you can make your own modifications if necessary).
